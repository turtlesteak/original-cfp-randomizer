 Original cfp randomizer, written in python

# --- 11 March 2022 ---
This is a python script used to randomize powers. 
Paste the code to the below website and run it. 
In the event a duplicate is rolled, the script will automatically reroll and output a valid set. 
If you do not have all powers unlocked, just delete the powers you do not have and you should be all set. 
Good luck and have fun :D
